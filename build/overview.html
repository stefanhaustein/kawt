The goal of the kAWT project is to provide a
simplified version of AWT for the KVM: The original com.sun.kjava
classes included in J2ME CLDC KVM 1.0 differ from the standard Java UI
components in many aspects. Thus, porting applications to the PDA
becomes a bit complicated. The most important problem is that only
limited support for event handling is provided by KVM. Our simplified
version of AWT does not let all AWT programs run on the Palm without
adoption, but at least the other way around should work: Applications
designed for kAWT should run on the "big brothers" of the KJava
platform without needing any additional modifications like wrapper
classes or similar.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the original AWT, the kAWT
is implemented all lightweight similar to SWING, 	
so for other platforms than PalmOS
only Graphics, Toolkit and a SpotletWrapper 
need to be ported. The tradeoff is getting 
the same "Look and Feel" on all platforms
since pluggable Look and Feel
is not supported in kAWT.
</p>
<p>
The current kAWT implementation is a "clean room" 
implementation not depending on original SUN Java 
code, but of course on the AWT documentation.
