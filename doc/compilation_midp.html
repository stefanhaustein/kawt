<h1>kAWT - Usage and compilation of kAWT with the Wireless Toolkit</h1>

In order to use kAWT in the Wireless Toolkit follow the steps listed below.
<ol>
<li>Create a new Project, e.g. KawtDemo</li>
<li>Since the new Wireless Toolkit v1.0.3 supports libraries, just copy the file <a href="../build/midp/kawt_midp.zip">kawt_midp.zip</a> 
file into the <tt>c:\programs\j2mewtk\apps\KawtDemo\lib</tt>directory</li>
<li>Save <a href="../demos/kawtdemo/KawtDemo.java">KawtDemo.java</a> in <tt>c:\j2mewtk\apps\kawtdemo\src</tt></li>
<li>Try to build and run the application.</li>
</ol>

if you want to create the MIDP distribution of kAWT yourself
you need to download the kAWT source distribution contained in 
<a href="../build/kawt_src.zip">kawt_src_zip</a>. 
Unzip the file into a directory called <b>c:\kawt</b> for instance.
After successfully unziped the kawt distribution 
install JDK 1.3 and the J2ME Wireless Toolkit.

Before we start to compile the kAWT version for MIDP/WTK we need to
setup some environment variables, add the MIDP API classes to the classpath and
add the previerifier to the PATH variable.

The following environment variables need to be added on a Win32 machine.
<ul>
  <li>MIDP_BCP=c:\j2mewtk\lib\midpapi.zip</li>
  <li>KAWT=c:\kawt</li>
  <li>KAWT_DRIVE=c:</li>
  <li>PATH=%PATH%;c:\j2mewtk\bin</li>
</ul>
Now you can change to the directory <b>kawt\bin</b> and run the <b>make_kawt_midp.bat</b> compiling
the kAWT version for MIDP. The zip file <b>kawt_midp.zip</b> containing the compiled and preverified 
classes can be found in the directory <b>kawt\build\midp</b> and can be used with the Wireless Toolkit as 
discussed in the first paragraph.
