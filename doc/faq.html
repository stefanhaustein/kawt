<a name="A1"><h3>Answer 1:</h3></a> 
This error occurs, if you haven't
installed the kawt.pdb class database. Please install at least the
file kawt.pdb onto you machine or POSE, or use the ColorKVM with
ROMized kAWT.

<a name="A2"><h3>Answer 2:</h3></a> 
This error occurs, if your
application wants to load the additional class java.io.FileInputStream
which is included inkawt_io_net.pdb or kio_net.pdb.  It's not possible
to install the files kawt_io_net.pdb of kio_net after kawt.pdb is
already installed. Please reinstall the KVM.prc and the KVMutil.prc.
After the KVM installation use kawt_io_net.pdb instead the kawt.pdb
file which contains only the java.awt-package. The package java.io is
also included in the ColorKVM with ROMized kAWT. If you are using the
ROMized ColorKVM no additonal pdb-class files are neccessary to run
the KawtSample, kCmd or kFtp.

For our ColorKVM we use new the
PalmOS3.5 feature set.  In older versions of PalmOS there are no
functions like <b>WinRGBToIndex</b> or <b>WinSetForeColor</b>
or <b>WinSetBackColor</b> to draw in color or grayscale mode. However the
Color feature is currently only available for PalmOS 3.5 devices.

<a name="A4"><h3>Answer 4:</h3></a> 
In kAWTv0.80 the method signature in MenuBar.add (Menu m) returns nothing (void) but in the AWT the method returns the inserted Menu.<br>
We have changed the signature of MenuBar's add() method to "public Menu add (Menu m)" in kAWTv0.81 to be compatible with the AWT MenuBar.<br>
Please recompile the KawtSample to solve this problem.

<p>
To increase the loading times of the kAWT Classes try to use the ColorKVM with ROMized kAWT. This kind of KVM is enhanced for the
use of kAWT and Color. ROMizing means that the additional kAWT classes are not loaded from an external database. The kAWT Classes are linked into
the ColorKVM as binaries. This speeds up the loading time e.g. for the KawtSample by factor 10.

<p>
In kAWT version 0.90 there is a new class <b>ImageItem</b> included to add an Image directly into a Panl like an other component. The following Example will show how to write a little sample application which shows an image in the "Center" of a Frame's Borderlayout.
<p>
The first step is to convert a GIF-Image to a bytearray. This is done using the <b>ByteArrayDumper</b>. This tool is available at the download section of the kAWT website (<a href="files/ByteArrayDumper.java">ByteArrayDumper.java</a>). To convert a GIF image like <a href="images/javacup.gif">javacup.gif</a> into a bytearray use the following command: <pre><b>java de.trantor.misc.ByteArrayDumper javacup.gif > javacup.java</b></pre> As result you will get the following file <a href="files/javacup.java">javacup.java</a> that looks like the following code:

If you place this bytearray into an application like <a href="files/ImageTest.java">ImageTest.java</a> you will gain this picture
after you sucessfully compiled, preverified and built a prc-file <a href="files/ImageTest_prc.zip">ImageTest_prc.zip</a> from it.

Please look at the Documentation Section, where you can find a description how to install kAWT and compile the KawtDemo application.

No, there is neither a routine for displaying the keyboard nor to display the numeric dialog from a KVM/kAWT application.

<a name="A11"><h3>Answer 11:</h3></a> 
The variable <tt>de.kawt.impl.kjava.ToolkitImpl.spotlet</tt> gives you access to the kAWT spotlet. There, you can call <tt>beamSend()</tt> directly. For <tt>beamReceive()</tt>, please register a class implementing <tt>de.kawt.impl.kjava.BeamListener</tt> using the <tt>setBeamListener()</tt> method.
