  </head> <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <h1>kAWT - Compiling and using the
Generic Connection Framework on the Desktop</h1> <p> Using kAWT, you
are able to create AWT applications that can be executed on the Palm
KVM and the desktop as well. But if you are interested in creating an
application that uses connections like sockets, you need to use the
javax.microedition.io classes of the generic connection
framework. These classes seem to be only available for the Java 2
Micro Edition on the first sight. However, looking into the source
code included in the CLDC KVM v1.0, you will see that the GCF is
available for the desktop, too. These classes just need to be compiled
and perhaps bundled into a jar file.</p>

<p> Using these classes, you are able to create kAWT applications that
use the GCF on both platforms, J2ME and the J2SE. Here we will explain
how to compile the GCF classes and describe a small demo
application that runs on the Palm KVM and the desktop. Finally, we will
describe how to create a jar file that contains all GCF classes.  </p>

<p> Before we start to explain the compiling steps, please install the KVM
that is available from
http://www.sun.com/software/communitysource/j2me/.  We recommend to
deflate the zip-files to drive "C:" of a Windows machine into the
directory "j2me_cldc".  </p>

<h2>Compilation</h2> 

<p>The source files required for running the GCF on the desktop
can be found in the directory "C:\j2me_cldc\api\src". Please copy the
directories "javax" and "com" from "C:\j2me_cldc\api\src" to a
directory like "C:\temp" where we can compile the GCF for
J2SE.</p>

<p>Please change to the directory
"C:\temp\javax\microedition\io" and run the following command:
<p>
<b>C:\temp\javax\microedition\io>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b>
</p>

<p>After compiling the source files of the 
javax.microedition.io package sucessfully, please change to the directory
"C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se" and run the same command as above:

<p>
<b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b>
</p>

<p>In this directory you can find the implementation of basic
protocols like "serversocket" and "socket" etc. Please change to
the directories of protocols you are interested to use on the
desktop and run the following commands:
<p>
<b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se\socket>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b><br>
<b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se\serversocket>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b><br>
<b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se\http>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b><br>
<b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se\datagram>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b><br>

<p>You can see that there is currently no comm protocol available for
the J2SE. In order to solve this problem, we implemented a protocol class
that acts as a wrapper for the J2SE Communications API. If you are 
interested in using the COMM protocol
on the desktop, you first need to install the Java
Communications API which can be downloaded from SUN: <a
href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/javacomm/index.html">http://www.javasoft.com/products/javacomm/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>After getting the Java Communications API, please create a directory called "comm" in "C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se"
and place the COMM Protocol implementation <a href="http://www.kroll-haustein.com/files/Protocol.java">Protocol.java</a>
into the "comm" directory. Then compile the protocol using the following command:</p>

<p><b>C:\temp\com\sun\cldc\io\j2se\comm>javac -classpath C:\temp *.java</b>
</p>

<p>If you have all the protocols compiled sucessfully, you can start 
to write applications using the GCF on J2SE.</p>

<h2>Generating a jar file</h2>

<p>To simplify usage of the Generic Connection Framework on the desktop,
we will now demonstrate how to create a jar file containing all 
GCF classes necessary for the J2SE.
We recommend to chage to the directory "C:\temp" and type the 
following command:
</p>

<b>
C:\temp>jar cvf gcf4j2se.jar javax/microedition/io/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/j
2se/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/j2se/datagram/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/j2se/http/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/
j2se/serversocket/*.class com/sun/cldc/io/j2se/socket/*.class
</b>
</p>

<p>As result, you will get the jar file "gcf4j2se.jar", which you can 
place in your classpath for usage with your own applications.


<h2>Demo applications for the GCF on the desktop</h2>

<p> In order to test the newly created desktop version
of the GCF, we use a so called ClockServer that is 
implemented as a command line application and  
encapsulates a server socket. On the client side,
we have implemented a small AWT application that 
receives and displays the current server time.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kroll-haustein.com/files/ClockServerME.java">ClockServerME.java</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kroll-haustein.com/files/ClockClientME.java">ClockClientME.java</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For demo purposes, we recommend that you store these 
two files in the "C:\temp" directory.
Please compile the two applications using the following command:
</p>

<p>
<b>C:\temp>javac -classpath .;gcf4j2se.jar *.java</b><br>
</p>

<p>To test that the desktop GCF is working,  please start the 
Server and the Client in two different shells using the 
following commands:

<ul>
<li>To start the server:<b>C:\temp>java -classpath .;gcf4j2se.jar ClockServerME</b></li>
<li>and for the client:<b>C:\temp>java -classpath .;gcf4j2se.jar ClockClientME</b></li>
</ul>

<p>After starting the applications, you will see one window with a waiting
server application, ready to send the current time to the client
application. The client application consists of a small kAWT
application connecting to the server and printing out the server time
into a list widget.
The following figure shows the server and the client after a successful
connection and transmission of the current server 
time over a socket:
