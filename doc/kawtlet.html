<h1>Running kAWT Applications as Applet or MIDlet</h1>

<p>In order to run kAWT applications as Applet or MIDlet,
they must be derived from the special wrapper class
<tt>de.kawt.KAWTlet</tt>. The KAWTlet works similar to
a MIDlet. The 
<a href="../demos/hellokawt/HelloKawt.java">HelloKawt.java</a>
file demonstrates a minimal implementation. The 
KAWTlet is invoked by a special wrapper class. The name
of the wrapper class is KawtWrapper, where the package name
depends on the target platform.</p>

<p>For compatibility, it is recommended to add a simple
main metod to the KAWTlet implementation that instantiates 
the KAWTlet and calls <tt>startApp ()</tt></p>   


<h2>Applet Sample Code</h2>

<pre>
&lt;applet code="de.kawt.impl.j2se.KawtWrapper.class" 
        WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="30"&gt;
  &lt;param name="KAWTlet" value="HelloKawt"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt; 
</pre>



<h2>MIDP Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Build a JAR file containing your application and the kAWT classes required for MIDP.</li>
<li>Enter "de.kawt.impl.midp.KawtWrapper" as MIDlet to be started in the JAD file.</li>
<li>Add a "KAWTlet" property to the JAD file. Enter  the class name of your KAWTlet implementation as value of the "KAWTlet property</li>
</ol>
